              "'I remember how our teachers used to ask us to build models of various things during our \\nsummer vacaƟon. SomeƟmes, it used to be a globe. SomeƟmes, a monument. And someƟmes, \\na volcano. \\nDuring one such summer vacaƟon, I was assigned the homework to build a model of a volcano. \\nI, like an obedient student, noted it down in my diary and came back home. Every year, my plan \\nfor summer vacaƟon was to ﬁnish the homework in the ﬁrst couple of weeks itself and then \\nspend the rest of the vacaƟon chilling out, but that never happened. That year wasn’t diﬀerent. \\nBut it was diﬀerent in a sense. I did ﬁnish all my homework in ﬁrst few weeks and spent the last \\nfew weeks making the volcano. \\nNow, before I tell anything further, let me tell you that I’ve realized that I’ve inherited, not \\nculƟvated, my gene of ‘building’ things. Everyone in my family appreciates making stuﬀ. I was \\ntold by my classmates that there are shops in the market that sold these pre-built models of \\nglobes and volcanos. I presented the proposal to my father, who straight away denied staƟng \\nthe reason, “If you’ll build, you’ll learn. If you don’t, you won’t.” \\nI wasn’t really happy about the situaƟon because making the model would take away at least a \\nweek out of my chilling Ɵme. Nevertheless, I started making. I started by zeroing on a solid base, \\nwhich I made out of a thick plywood. I coated the plywood with paper mash to give it a texture. \\nI then started looking out for a foundaƟonal shape on top of which I could build my volcano. I \\nfound an unused earthen utensil. \\nBy this Ɵme, I was joined by my brothers in helping me build the volcano. I decided to cover the \\nearthen utensil using paper mash in the shape of a volcano and planned to color it in bright red \\nas if lava is pouring out. Apparently, the plan didn’t impress my brothers. They said, “Paper \\nmash?! Really?! Bad choice. You’ll paint the lava?! Bad choice again. If we are doing it, then let’s \\ndo it properly.” Then they concluded their complaints with the phrase, “LAVA MUST FLOW.” \\nWe threw away my paper mash base, and instead built again using plaster of Paris. We used the \\nearthen utensil and erected a pipe in the center of it before covering it up with thick layers of \\nplaster of Paris. We then brought out our set of oil colors and colored it in not just bright red, \\nbut in the shades of black, green and red. The project took us a week to complete, and it looked \\nlike a real volcano, not the ones you see in cartoons. \\nIt was the Ɵme for lava. My elder brother mixed red food color and baking soda and poured it in \\nthe pipe that made the mouth of the volcano. We leŌ it to dry under the sun and within a day, it \\nwas ready. It turned out to be quite heavy. I remember, how when the schools reopened, I was \\nholding the model of volcano wrapped in the newspaper and was trying to ﬁnd a seat on the \\nschool bus. Upon reaching the school, everyone kept their models in a corner of the class. Everyone who \\nwas assigned the homework to make the model of the volcano had submiƩed very similar \\nlooking models as if one person made them all. I realized my model was way diﬀerent than \\ntheirs. I liked mine but I was embarrassed to reveal my over-engineered model and therefore, I \\nsubmiƩed mine covered in the newspaper. I didn’t unwrap it. \\nEveryone, one by one, showed their models to the teacher and got the marks awarded for it. \\nThe teacher too menƟoned, “You weren’t supposed to buy the models. You were supposed to \\nmake them yourself.” At that point, I wanted to stand up and tell the teacher that I had made \\nmine and it sat in the corner of the class wrapped under the newspapers. But I didn’t. More \\nthan pride, I was embarrassed to have such a diﬀerent volcano than everyone else. \\nIn my mind, I was saying, “If my brothers hadn’t overtaken my project, I would have shown my \\nmodel too and got the marks awarded.” \\nMonths passed and my model sƟll lay there in the corner, wrapped in the newspaper. The year \\nwas approaching the conclusion and by then, I had given up hopes of ever revealing my \\nhomework to the teacher. One day, when not many students were present in the class, the \\nteacher announced, “I won’t teach today as there aren’t many people. You people can do \\nwhatever you feel like.” She then turned to the class monitor and asked, “Let’s clean the \\nalmirah. It contains lots of waste from the summer vacaƟon submissions.” \\nAlong with the class monitor, the teacher started cleaning the almirah, throwing everything that \\nit contained. Many models were broken by then, and she picked up and threw them in the \\ndustbin. Somewhere near the boƩom of the almirah, she encountered a model covered in the \\nnewspaper. She tried to liŌ it and noƟced it was unusually heavy. She turned to the class \\nmonitor and asked, “What’s this?” \\n“I don’t know, madam.” \\nShe tore the newspaper and under it sat my model. My volcano. The one with black, green and \\nred shades. It had accumulated some dust then but the teacher dusted it, picked it up and kept \\nit on the table. She saw it from various angles as if she was trying to ﬁnd something on it. She \\nseemed to ﬁnd it when she called out, “Mohit.” \\nI stood up. She asked, “Is it yours?” \\n“Yes, madam.” \\n“I don’t remember seeing it during the submissions. Have you submiƩed it yet?” \\n“No, madam.” \\n“Why?” “Because… Because, it’s diﬀerent, madam. It’s diﬀerent from the other volcanos that you saw.” \\nShe smiled at me, I turned embarrassingly redder. She then said, “This volcano will always stay \\nin the almirah of the staﬀ room, Mohit. This is beauƟful. And you’re therefore awarded full \\nmarks for your summer vacaƟon.” \\nI then, said, “This works too, madam.” \\nShe didn’t understand what I said. I clariﬁed, “If you pour some vinegar in the mouth of the \\nvolcano, the lava will ﬂow. My brothers said, ‘Lava must ﬂow.’” \\nI don’t know if she ever tried pouring in the vinegar but I do know that she kept that volcano on \\ntop of the staﬀ room’s almirah. That almirah was to showcase the best of the models every year. \\nThe top of the almirah was what Oscars are to movies. Every day, I’d cross the staﬀ room gazing \\nat my volcano that sat silently on top of the almirah. It stayed there for several years and then I \\nleŌ the school. \\n '"
